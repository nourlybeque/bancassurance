üè¶ Project Title: Predicting Customer Propensity to Buy Insurance in a Bank<br/>
üéØ Goal: Use customer data from a bank to build a predictive model that identifies clients most likely to purchase insurance products (e.g., life insurance, credit protection, property insurance).<br/>

üìä Project Workflow: <br/>

1. Business Understanding<br/>
- Banks often offer insurance products to their existing clients.
- Goal: improve cross-selling by targeting the right customers.

2. Data Collection<br/>
- Bank transaction records
- Customer profiles (age, income, job type, loan history)
- Product purchase history (including insurance)
- Call center and marketing campaign logs

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing<br/>
- Handling missing values (e.g., unknown job type)
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding for education level)
- Normalizing numeric features (e.g., income)
- Feature engineering:
-- Total balance trend
-- Number of products owned
-- Recent campaign responses

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br/>
- Compare insurance buyers vs. non-buyers
- Correlation heatmaps
- Analyze age/income groups with higher purchase rates

5. Modeling<br/>
Use classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
<br/>
Target variable: Bought_Insurance (Yes/No)<br/>
Evaluate performance with metrics: AUC, F1-score, precision-recall<br/>

6. Model Interpretation<br/>
- Feature importance: e.g., age, prior campaign response, account balance
- SHAP values (if using tree models) to explain individual predictions

7. Deployment / Recommendation<br/>
- Use model output to rank customers for the next campaign
- Deliver list to marketing or sales teams
- Monitor real conversion rates vs. predicted scores

üìà Business Impact:<br/>
- Higher ROI on marketing campaigns
- Better customer targeting
- Improved customer experience (less spammy offers)
